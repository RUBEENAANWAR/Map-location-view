# **Map and Location Saver App**



This project is a simple web application with two tabs: one for displaying a map and another for listing saved locations. The application allows users to select a location on the map, save the location details, and view the saved locations.


## **Features**
- **Map Tab**

Loads a map using a map library (e.g., Leaflet, Google Maps API).
Allows users to tap on a location, triggering a pop-up.
Pop-up displays the title, location place text (retrieved via API), latitude, longitude, and time.
Users can save the location details to local storage.

- **Locations Tab**

Displays a list of saved locations.
Allows users to click on a location in the list to open the map with a marker on the selected location.
